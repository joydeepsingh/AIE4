            "\n",
            "1. **Using a `for` loop**: This is often the most Pythonic way to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string). \n",
            "\n",
            "   ```python\n",
            "   # Example of a for loop\n",

            "   for fruit in fruits:\n",
            "       print(fruit)\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Using a `while` loop**: This is useful when you want to repeat a block of code as long as a condition is true.\n",
            "\n",
            "   ```python\n",
            "   # Example of a while loop\n",
            "   count = 0\n",
            "   while count < 5:\n",
            "       print(count)\n",
            "       count += 1\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Looping with indices**: If you need both the index and the value from a list, you can use the `enumerate` function.\n",
            "\n",
            "   ```python\n",
            "   # Using enumerate\n",
            "   animals = [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"rabbit\"]\n",
            "   for index, animal in enumerate(animals):\n",
            "       print(f\"Index {index}: {animal}\")\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **List comprehensions**: If you're generating a list based on a loop, consider using a list comprehension for clarity and conciseness.\n",
            "\n",
            "   ```python\n",
            "   # Example of a list comprehension\n",
            "   squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n",
            "   print(squares)\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Breaking and continuing**: Use `break` to exit a loop early and `continue` to skip to the next iteration, which can help in managing flow in complex loops.\n",
            "\n",
            "   ```python\n",
            "   # Example of break and continue\n",
            "   for number in range(10):\n",
            "       if number == 5:\n",
            "           break  # Exit the loop when number is 5\n",
            "       if number % 2 == 0:\n",
            "           continue  # Skip even numbers\n",
            "       print(number)\n",

This behavior often stems from a desire to maintain control and remain perceived as the expert in that area, rather than hiring someone stronger who could overshadow them. The example given is of Michael Eisner, the former CEO of Disney, who struggled with the ABC network after acquiring it and believed he could turn it around himself if he had more time, illustrating the pitfalls of hiring someone weaker than oneself in a critical executive role.\",\n",
